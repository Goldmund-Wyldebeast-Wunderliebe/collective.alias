collective.alias - to-do
========================

Bugs
----

  [ ] Aliasing of methods
        - currently, we re-bind methods so that im_self is the Alias
        - this fails on e.g. BaseObject.__getitem__(self, item)
        - we either need to make Alias appear to subclass the same things,
            or find a different solution based on proxies

  [ ] Possible problems on catalog deletion
        - seems we may get stale objects if either alias or target is deleted?

Edge cases
----------
 
 [ ] Implement folder behaviour by mixing in plone.folder
        - Alias is folderish if the target is folderish
        - Alias can only contain other aliases by default (?)
        - A folder listing on an alias of a folder shows items in the alias
            folder, using the settings and metadata of the target folder
        - Traversal to sub-items should not delegate

Integration
-----------

 [ ] Alias needs to be re-indexed when object is modified
        - set marker on the aliased object
        - register event handler for IObjectModifiedEvent on this marker
        - rebroadcast IObjectModifiedEvent on alias(es)

 [ ] Decide how to link to edit form
        - With the Alias FTI rendered useless, we can't merge the actions

 [ ] Make alias more read-only
        - Currently, it's too easy to get to an edit screen and set attributes
          on the alias by accident
        - Find a way to hide actions (e.g. edit tab)?
        - Use __setattr__ to stop setting attributes not pre-defined?

 [ ] Disable 'display' menu
        - or at least disallow setting a different layout

Missing
-------
 
 [ ] Add functional tests!
        - Probably want to use testbrowser for most of these

New functionality
-----------------

 [ ] Allow title override?
 [ ] Allow optionally showing link to original (in a viewlet?)
 [ ] Add icon overlay
 [ ] Implement "paste as alias" action
 [ ] Optionally keep workflow state + permissions in sync?
    - event driven?
 [ ] Optionally allow traversal to children of target
    - do not create fake catalog entries
    - regular folder listings won't work
