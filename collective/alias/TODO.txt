collective.alias - to-do
========================

Bugs/to test
------------

  [x] File content

  [x] Image content
        - including thumbnails in folder_summary_view
  
  [x] News item images
  
  [x] Folder content
        - should retain settings of target
        - should not show children of target
  
  [x] Comments
        - should be shared
  
  [x] Permissions/different workflow states
        - permissions should be taken from the alias, not the target

  [x] Acquired content
        - probably wrapped in target object

  [x] Annotations (e.g. locks, contextual portlets)
        - should be shared

  [x] Aliasing of methods

  [x] Cataloging of alias
        - alias created/renamed/moved/deleted

  [ ] Cataloging when target changed
        - target created/renamed/moved/deleted/modified
  
Edge cases
----------
 
 [ ] Implement folder behaviour by mixing in plone.folder
        - Alias is folderish if the target is folderish
        - Alias can only contain other aliases by default (?)
        - A folder listing on an alias of a folder shows items in the alias
            folder, using the settings and metadata of the target folder
        - Traversal to sub-items should not delegate

Integration
-----------

 [ ] Alias needs to be re-indexed when object is modified
        - set marker on the aliased object
        - register event handler for IObjectModifiedEvent on this marker
        - rebroadcast IObjectModifiedEvent on alias(es)

 [ ] Decide how to link to alias edit form
        - and not to target edit form
        - may need to customise the edit content actions viewlet

 [ ] Make alias more read-only
        - currently, it's too easy to get to an edit screen and set attributes
          on the alias by accident
        - find a way to hide actions (e.g. edit tab)?
        - disallow portlet management
        - use __setattr__ to stop setting attributes not pre-defined?

 [ ] Handle aliases of aliases
        - need to find underlying target object and adjust relation 
          accordingly

 [ ] Allow different display templates
        - default to whatever the display template on the target was
        - allow override via 'display' menu
        - also allow setting default page (not defaulted)

Missing
-------
 
 [ ] Add integration/functional tests!
        - Probably want to use testbrowser for most of these

New functionality
-----------------

 [ ] Allow title override?
 [ ] Allow optionally showing link to original (in a viewlet?)
 [ ] Add optional icon overlay
 [ ] Implement "paste as alias" action
 [ ] Optionally keep workflow state + permissions in sync?
        - set marker interface on source
        - register event handler
 [ ] Optionally allow traversal to children of target
        - do not create fake catalog entries
        - regular folder listings won't work
